# 🛠️ My Personal NeoVim Configuration

Welcome to my NeoVim setup! Below is a quick overview of the plugins I use, along with some personal thoughts and experiences.

---

## 🎨 Color Scheme

- **Status**: Vague  
  Still searching for a color scheme I truly like — suggestions welcome!

## 🔌 Plugins Overview

### 🔁 Buffer & File Management

- **Harpoon 2**  
  Great for managing buffers.  
  - `vH` to mark a file  
  - `vh` to open the buffer list  

- **Neo-tree**  
  I don’t use it often, but it’s useful to visualize the project structure when needed.

- **Oil** 🚀  
  My favorite plugin.  
  Super intuitive file manager — truly the GOAT.

- **Bufferline** ❌  
  Disabled — I just hate tabs.

---

### 🧠 Coding Experience

- **nvim-cmp**  
  Completion system. Still figuring out how to configure it properly — kind of crazy but powerful.

- **nvim-treesitter**  
  Syntax highlighting and code understanding — works fine, nothing to say.

- **Mason**  
  Mostly using it for code color support — does the job.

---

### 🔧 Terminal & Git Tools

- **LazyGit**  
  Awesome for managing commits and pushes.  
  _Downside_: Can’t do `git pull origin` to get all branches — I need to handle that in the terminal.

- **ToggleTerm**  
  Decent floating terminal.  
  Occasionally buggy, but generally does what I need.

- **Wakatime**  
  Great for tracking my coding time and performance.

---

### 🔍 Productivity

- **Telescope**  
  Super powerful fuzzy finder. Still learning how to customize it.

- **Which-key**  
  Love it. Helps me remember keymaps — no complaints here.

- **Zen Mode**  
  Haven’t tried it yet, but it’s there when I need to focus.

- **Undotree**  
  Also not used yet, but could be useful in the future.

## 🧠 Custom Keybindings

- `<Space> + t` → Open a floating terminal (via ToggleTerm)  
- `-` → Open **Oil** (aka the GOAT 🐐)
